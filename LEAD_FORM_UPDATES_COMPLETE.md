# Lead Form Updates - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully updated the ELS CRM lead creation and editing forms to replace the status field with a Lead Stage dropdown and add a Lead Source text field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Add Lead Form (`templates/add_lead.html`)
- **Removed**: Generic "status" field
- **Added**: Lead Stage dropdown with options:
  - MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) - **Default selection**
  - SAL (Sales Accepted Lead)  
  - SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)
- **Added**: Lead Source text field with placeholder "e.g., Website, Referral, Trade Show"
- **Updated**: Form styling for consistency and better UX

### 2. Edit Lead Form (`templates/edit_lead.html`)  
- **Added**: Lead Source field to both:
  - Information display section (read-only view)
  - Edit form section (editable field)
- **Updated**: Lead Stage dropdown to show current selection
- **Enhanced**: Consistent field labeling and styling

### 3. Backend Updates (`routes/main.py`)
#### Add Lead Route
- **Updated**: Form handling to capture `stage` and `source` fields
- **Set**: Default stage to "MQL" if not provided
- **Mapped**: Form data correctly to Lead model

#### Edit Lead Route  
- **Added**: Lead Source field handling in form processing
- **Updated**: Lead update logic to include source field
- **Maintained**: Validation for required fields

### 4. Leads List View (`templates/leads.html`)
- **Added**: "Source" column to the leads table
- **Updated**: Table headers and data cells
- **Maintained**: Responsive design and filtering functionality

### 5. Database Model Verification
- **Confirmed**: Lead model already includes `source` field in `models.py`
- **Verified**: All field mappings are consistent across templates and backend

## Technical Implementation Details

### Form Field Mapping
```python
# Add Lead Route
lead = Lead(
    contact_person=f"{request.form['first_name']} {request.form['last_name']}",
    company_name=request.form.get('company', 'Unknown'),
    email=request.form['email'],
    phone=request.form.get('phone'),
    source=request.form.get('source'),           # NEW
    stage=request.form.get('stage', 'MQL'),      # UPDATED (was status)
    created_by=current_user.id
)

# Edit Lead Route  
lead.source = source.strip() if source else None  # NEW
lead.stage = stage                                 # UPDATED (was status)
```

### Template Updates
```html
<!-- Lead Stage Dropdown -->
<select id="stage" name="stage" required>
    <option value="MQL" selected>MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead)</option>
    <option value="SAL">SAL (Sales Accepted Lead)</option>
    <option value="SQL">SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)</option>
</select>

<!-- Lead Source Text Field -->
<input type="text" id="source" name="source" 
       placeholder="e.g., Website, Referral, Trade Show">
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Lead Creation
1. **Simplified Selection**: Dropdown is clearer than text input for stage
2. **Smart Default**: MQL is pre-selected as the most common starting stage
3. **Source Tracking**: New field helps track lead attribution
4. **Clear Labels**: Descriptive field names and placeholders

### Lead Management  
1. **Consistent Interface**: Add and edit forms now match
2. **Better Visibility**: Source column in leads table
3. **Comprehensive View**: Edit page shows all lead information
4. **Efficient Workflow**: Stage progression is clear and trackable

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Local Flask application running successfully
- ✅ Add lead form displays correctly with new fields
- ✅ Edit lead form includes source field
- ✅ Leads table shows source column
- ✅ Backend handles all form fields correctly
- ✅ Database model supports all required fields
- ✅ Git commit and push completed

## Status
**COMPLETE** - All requested lead form updates have been successfully implemented and tested.

The lead creation process now uses:
- **Lead Stage dropdown** defaulting to MQL (instead of status field)
- **Lead Source text field** for better lead attribution tracking
- **Consistent UI/UX** across add/edit forms and list view

## Next Steps
Ready for deployment to Azure or additional feature requests.
