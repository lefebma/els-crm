## 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Current State Verification
The database currently has:
- 4 users (none with organizations yet)
- 10 leads, 11 accounts, 6 contacts, 6 opportunities (all without organization_id)

### Manual Testing Workflow

1. **Access the Application**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

2. **Test Organization Setup**
   - Login as existing user (e.g., demo/demo123)
   - You'll see a "Users" link in navigation
   - Go to Users page and click "Set Up Organization"
   - Create organization name (e.g., "Demo Company")
   - User becomes admin of the organization

3. **Test User Invitation**
   - As admin, go to Users → Invite User
   - Enter email address of another user
   - They will be added to your organization

4. **Test Data Sharing**
   - Create new leads/accounts/contacts as admin
   - Login as invited user
   - Verify they can see and edit the shared data
   - Both users see the same CRM data

5. **Test User Management**
   - As admin, go to Users → Manage Users
   - View organization members
   - Toggle admin privileges
   - Remove users from organization

### Database Verification Commands
```python
# Check organization setup
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('/Users/marclefebvre/Projects/ELS CRM/instance/crm.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Check users with organizations
cursor.execute("SELECT username, organization_id, is_admin FROM users WHERE organization_id IS NOT NULL")
print("Users with organizations:", cursor.fetchall())

# Check shared data
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads WHERE organization_id IS NOT NULL")
print("Leads with organization:", cursor.fetchone()[0])
```
